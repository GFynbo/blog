summary:    I was always able to create nifty little websites that did what I want and followed basic steps, but I never felt confident truly developing anything. In an attempt to help someone else and teach myself in the process I decided to develop a website for a small local business.

## Experience

I had created websites for myself and things I was interested in for a long time
before I started this project. One time I even created this web application in PHP
for a family friend who needed a way to manage his contracts for his business. Needless
to say creating one application with PHP for a family friend was not quite the same
as freelancing or making websites for money. I didn't know what to charge, I didn't
know where to start, and I didn't know what steps to take.

## Research

Naturally the first steps I took was to do some research on this whole 'freelancing'
thing that everyone always talks about. I had some faint ideas on where to start,
but didn't know how complex the questions I was asking would become. It is not as
simple as 'who, what, and where' because the questions are so complicated and take
months if not years to understand. However, I didn't have that kind of time on my hands.
This project needed to start and I needed to show something to the client.

One of the most important things that I realized during the research phase of
this project was that it would never be perfect. As perfectionist I had to come to
grips with the fact that I would make something great for the client and they would
be happy regardless if I spent those extra two hours figuring out the most optimal
CMS to use. That being said, I also realized that just because I needed to stop, didn't
mean that I could produce anything other than something great. Once I realized that I
needed a solid base of communication outlining what the client wanted I could
customize the project to their needs.

After some research (hours) and brainstorming, I came to the conclusion that the
best situation was a site created with Wordpress with a special thanks to
[/freelance](http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance) and [/web_design](http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design).
It was friendly, but still allowed developers such as myself to harness the system.
The client wanted to be able to add updates and manage parts of the site themselves,
so it became clear that the ideal situation for both of us was Wordpress. I had used Wordpress
in the past and thought that the transition from casual use to developing for a customer
would be quick and painless. Perhaps the biggest lesson I learned here was that
things on the surface appear much more simple than they often are, such as icebergs.
This is especially true in software and web development.

## Development

Post-research I looked at multiple hosts and landed on [SiteGround](http://www.siteground.com)
based of reviews of reliability and price. Additionally, I developed most of the site
locally using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info) using an extremely popular parent theme framework
called [Gensis](http://www.studiopress.com). Using hooks and PHP I was able to create everything
I wanted to thanks to the simplicity of the program. The experience has been mostly
positive with only minor grievances related to the documentation of the framework.
In the past I have been more interested in software development regarding C++, Java and Python.

## Reflection

The whole experience has been a learning curve and beneficial to me and my skillset,
however in the future I think I will stick to something that is more closely related
to software development and more programming. I tend to think I have a pretty good
eye for aesthetics, but I am no designer, that's far too complex. I have a feeling
my next project will be running on Ruby on Rails, and I look forward to that project
with an open mind.

## Recommendations

If you're looking to go into web development or freelancing, make sure you know the
difference between the two. They're related, but don't confuse them for the same
thing, you will end up sorely disappointed. Freelancing is hard, time consuming work
that is no joke. Freelancing is difficult and you don't have any senior managers or
developers to look up to or use for learning. The best thing I can recommend for
someone looking into freelancing, read, read, read. It never hurts to read and
research the field before you jump into it and it is a complex field. If I could
change one thing, lay out an extremely solid framework for features and items that
are expected to be developed by you. Godspeed.
