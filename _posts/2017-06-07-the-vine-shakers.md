summary:    I was always able to create nifty little websites that did what I want and followed basic steps, but I never felt confident truly developing anything. In an attempt to help someone else and teach myself in the process I decided to develop a website for a small local business.

## Experience

I had created websites for myself and things I was interested in for a long time
before I started this project. One time I even created this web application in PHP
for a family friend who needed a way to manage his contracts for his business. Needless
to say creating one application with PHP for a family friend was not quite the same
as freelancing or making websites for money. I didn't know what to charge, I didn't
know where to start, and I didn't know what steps to take.

## Research

Naturally the first steps I took was to do some research on this whole 'freelancing'
thing that everyone always talks about. I had some faint ideas on where to start,
but didn't know how big the questions I were asking were.
